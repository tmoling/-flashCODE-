# Coding Flashcards

FlashCODE is a website that will allow coding students to practice their knowledge in web development.
A random question (or flashCODE) will appear and the user will type in their response. The app will then tell you if you're right.
Users' log-in information will be saved into a MySQL database. In addition to HTML and JavaScript, this app also uses Node, Express and Handlebars.
Feel free to clone this project and add your own questions to the database.
Happy coding!

This app was designed by Jake Boldbataar, Troy Moling and Ryan Walters.
